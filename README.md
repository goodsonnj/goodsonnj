### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Nic Goodson, but my full name is Nicholas Goodson. I spell it "Nic" and not "Nick" because of that.
Currently I'm working on CS 154, which is a bit daunting at the moment, I think largely due to technical errors and just getting used to all of the new software.
When I'm not studying, I like to do my hobbies. At home, I like to skateboard, surf, do ceramics, cook, challenge myself with foreign languages, play soccer and basketball, and ski. Although, I'm not exactly sure how the skateboarding will work out in Maine (it won't).
